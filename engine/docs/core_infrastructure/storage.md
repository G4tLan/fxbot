## Overview
The `storage/` directory is used for persistent artifacts generated by engine. It ensures that logs, results, and local databases are kept organized.

## Directory Structure

Contains text log files.
- **Usage**: Debugging backtests or live sessions.
- **Format**: `[TIMESTAMP] ==> Message`

### `storage/json/` & `storage/csv/`
Contains exported results from backtests.
- **Usage**: Users can choose to export their backtest metrics and trade history to these formats for external analysis.

### `storage/db/`

- **Usage**: Stores candles and trade history locally.

### `storage/charts/`
